# Teas I've enjoyed

## Japan

### [Sencha Yutaka Midori](https://www.o-cha.com/yutaka-midori.html) from O-Cha

Easily my favourite sencha. Careful with the temperature!

Pre-heat 100ml gaiwan, ~4 grams leaves, smell... ahh.

Brews:

1. brew 65°C half a minute
2. 65°C strain immediately
3. 70°C perhaps 10 seconds
4. improvise based on previous results


### Sencha Asanoka Hi Ire

No idea, bought in Probuzený Slon perhaps?


### [Yame Gyokuro](https://www.o-cha.com/yame-gyokuro.html) from O-Cha

Use lotsa leaf!

1. perhaps 50°C half a minute
2. 50°C strain immediately



## China

### [13 years aged Da Hong Pao](https://yunnansourcing.com/products/13-years-aged-da-hong-pao-rock-oolong-tea) from Yunnan Sourcing

Easy brew, start at 90°C and take it from there.


### Tie Guan Yin

Looking for my favourite...


### [Long Mei Yunnan](https://yunnansourcing.com/products/long-mei-yunnan-green-tea-of-zhenyuan)

Super easy brew green tea. Best to start from 80°C, but anything goes. Makes an insane amount of brewings for a green tea.

### 2016 Yunnan Sourcing "Red Monkey" Raw Pu-erh Tea Mini Cake

A good young cheap sheng puerh, no longer available.

### [Laoshan Green](https://yunnansourcing.com/products/imperial-grade-laoshan-green-tea-from-shandong)

I've tried the imperial variety, which was mighty impressive, with some sencha-like characteristics while being much easier to brew. To do: try the classic and competition grades.
