# Walking in the Air

[Verse 1]  
We're walking in the air  
We're floating in the moonlit sky  
The people far below  
Are sleeping as we fly  
I'm holding very tight  
I'm riding in the midnight blue  
I'm finding I can fly  
So high above with you  

[Verse 2]  
Far across the world  
The villages go by like dreams  
The rivers and the hills  
The forests and the streams  

[Bridge]  
Children gaze open-mouthed  
Taken by surprise  
Nobody down below  
Believes their eyes  

[Verse 3]  
We're surfing in the air  
We're swimming in the frozen sky  
We're drifting over icy  
Mountains floating by  

[Bridge]  
Suddenly swooping low  
On an ocean deep  
Rousing up a mighty monster  
From his sleep  

[Verse 4]  
We're walking in the air  
We're dancing in the midnight sky  
And everyone who sees us  
Greets us as we fly
