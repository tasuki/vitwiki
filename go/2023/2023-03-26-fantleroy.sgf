C[Fantleroy: thank you for the game
tasuki: hah thanks
tasuki: interesting game, not very good for me ;)
Fantleroy: i massively threw on the top left
Fantleroy: I thought I would get either top or left but ended up with neither
Fantleroy: [object Object\]
tasuki: I misread the upper right a little...
tasuki: yes that makes sense
tasuki: I saw I made the push too late
Fantleroy: B15 lost a lot it seems
Fantleroy: C13 was also disastreous it sems
Fantleroy: seems*
Fantleroy: well, a lot to review for stanislaw haha
Fantleroy: ah, forgot to write  IGLO
tasuki: oh I'm surprised after F8 it's 2.4 pts for you
tasuki: I thought it was game over at that point
tasuki: I have two weak groups and nothing else
tasuki: you have a huge corner
Fantleroy: AI think I shouldn't have chickened out after b a18
Fantleroy: I wasn't sure and thought I would get to kill H16 stones
tasuki: yes of course, I thought so too
Fantleroy: but B19 living in sente I completely missed
tasuki: but playing a won position is much harder :P
Fantleroy: always yeah haha
Fantleroy: anyway, I need to go now
Fantleroy: see you !
tasuki: good night!
