# Favourite board games

At a random point in time, so not entirely ordered.

- A Feast For Odin: Caverna and Patchwork had a baby
- Scythe: a nice blend of euro and us game, significant but not all-important conflict
- Race For The Galaxy: cards cards cards, use them to pay for stuff, build them; features simultaneous action selection!
- Through the Ages, A New Story of Civilization: a bit too complex, makes sense on BGA
