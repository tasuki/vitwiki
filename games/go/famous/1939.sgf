(;B[qd]SZ[19]EV[Kamakura jubango]DT[1939-09-28]PC[near Kamakura]PB[Kitani Minoru]BR[8dan]PW[Go Seigen]WR[7dan]RE[W+2]US[tasuki]C[Played on 28 and 29 September 1939.  Event: Game 1 of second ten-game match ("Kamakura jubango"), sponsored by the Yomiuri Shinbun.  Time limits: 13 hours each.  276 moves. White wins by 2 points.  The games were played in the Kenkuji, Engakuji and Hachimaiju Temples near Kamakura, which is why it is called the Kamakura jubango. The game recorder for the first game was Miss Hagiwara Sachiko.  The game fee for each game was Yen 700. Both players were accommodated in the Kamakura Beach Hotel.  At the start of the first game both players were wearing full Japanese dress of haori and hakama and had folding fans. The colours for the first game had not been chosen in advance so they were chosen by nigiri, Go taking handfuls of white stones and Kitani saying "Even", which proved to be correct, so Kitani took Black. ];C[ 1 minute. ]W[pp];C[ 5 minutes. ]B[dq];C[ 8 minutes. ]W[nd];C[ 2 minutes. ]

(;B[oc]C[ 15 minutes. Kitani said after the game that if he had played at "a".. ];W[dn]C[ 1 minute. It was noted that both players were proceeding cautiously. ];B[fp];W[dc];B[od]
(;W[ne]C[ Normally White 10 would be at "a", skipping away lightly. White 10 was a new idea of Go's and this was the second time he had tried it. This pattern has hardly ever appeared in professional games since, but Go has played countless new moves like this. ];B[oe];W[nf]
(;B[nc]C[ In an earlier game between them (GO333.GO or KIT48.GO) the same pattern up to 13 had appeared and, in his commentary, the Meijin, Honinbo Shusai, had said that Black 13 should be on the second line (at "a"). Kitani played 13 again; in his comments after the game, he said "I don't like playing knight's moves. This Black 13 has no theory behind it, it is simply my choice." ]
(;W[cf]C[ White 14 took 19 minutes. Go did consider playing White 14 at "a". However, 14 is the greediest of the corner enclosures. Go commented that "I have to be greedy as I am playing White". It should be remembered that there was no komi in this game. Normally every game played today has komi and playing White without komi is almost inconceivable, but Go's almost clear sweep in ten-game matches were all without komi. If White has a large komi, such as five and a half points, naturally his whole way of playing from the opening onward changes. ];B[ic];W[gc]
(;B[kc]C[ Most professionals would probably play at "a". Black 17 is perhaps an example of the Kitani style at it's most extreme. ]
(;W[cp]C[ White 18 took 17 minutes; Go was using his time steadily. Go commented that he was unsure of where he should play for White 18. The thinking behind 18 is to create a tedomari (or last-big-point) situation, so that whichever side Black approaches White \\t, there is miai for White. If Black plays at A, White plays at B and C and D are miai. If Black plays at E and White at F, then G and C are miai. White 18 is a preliminary move before White 20. It seems a little early but Go did not believe he would have a chance to play at "a" in the middle game. ];B[cq]C[ Black 17 and 19 are both part of a strategy of wait-and-see while securing territory and this is reasonable enough in a no-komi game. ]
(;W[ck]C[ White 20 at "a" or "b" would have been a more balanced play but..]
(;B[of]C[ Kitani commented that Black 21 was a bit too solid. Normally the move to make is an approach to the lower right corner on one side or the other. ]
(;W[qj]C[ Go commented that he wasn't sure whether to play at 22 or at "a". ]
(;B[ng]C[ Kitani commented that Black 23 could also have been at "a". ]
(;W[qm]C[ Go commented that, once Black was able to turn at 23, White's position on the right becomes thin, so he reinforced with 24. If White 24 were at "a".. ]
(;B[jq]C[ Kitani commented that he thought of playing at "a".. "But I thought, well, 25 is after all a big point". ]
(;W[oq]C[ Go  said that playing White 26 one point further on at "a" would give him a position like the early Edo swordsman Miyamoto Musashi; one sword in the right hand and one in the left. ]
(;B[mq]C[ Kitani commented that perhaps he should have played at "a". It is clear to see that Black's fuseki up to 27 was just what he wanted, while White is confident of his speed of fuseki development.];W[mg]C[ Now White finally returned to his three stones at the top and turned at 28. It was now 2 o'clock in the afternoon. ]
(;B[mh]C[ Black 29 was a spirited move; if he plays at "a".. ];W[nh];B[og]
(;W[jd]C[ White 32 is a probe. Simply extending at "a".. ]
(;B[id]C[ If Black plays at "a".. or if at "b".. ];W[lg]
(;B[mi]C[ If Black played 35 at "a".. ];W[jg]
(;B[bp]C[ Black 37 is a Kitani-style move. Go commented that, if Black had played at "a".. "I was looking for an opportunity to descend at 37 myself". Kitani said after the game that the one-space jump to "a" is commonsense. Nevertheless, Black 37 is consistent with the style of the earlier moves. ]
(;W[ip]C[ Go said that a White move at "a" instead of 38 would have no effect on Black. If White blocked at "b".. ];B[jp];W[io];B[iq]C[ Play on the first day finished on move 40, Black 41 being the sealed move. ];W[gp]
(;B[gq]C[ If Black pushes up at "a".. ];W[go];B[fq]
(;W[oj]C[ Go commented that a move at "a" instead of 46 would leave bad aji. ]
(;B[oi]C[ When Black played at 47, Kato Shin, who was watching, said that Ota Yuzo of the Tempo Top Four would not have defended but would have played at "a". ];W[nj];B[ni];W[kd]
(;B[lc]C[ Kitani said that Black 51 could have been the connection at "a" but 51 aims next at jumping to A. ]
(;W[co]C[ If White does not play at 52.. White 52 seems like a heavy move but it also defends against the Black jump at A, and White would have difficulty defending against this. There was also the excellent big move at "b", but Go was not completely happy with it. ]
(;B[qh]C[ Go suggested that "a" would have been better than Black 53, but Kitani wanted White to have one more stone to complete his moyo and then to invade.];W[gg]C[ When White plays 54 his framework finally takes shape and Black is faced with the problem of how to invade. Go had remarked on the first day that if the left side remained as it was, it would not be attacked. But if White added another move, Black would invade at once. ]
(;B[gi]C[ Kitani said that there were various moves elsewhere he considered, but he would have regretted settling the shapes, so he tried 55. His consideration of 55 took 1 hour and 15 minutes from 11.29 in the morning to 1.57 in the afternoon (including the lunch break). Kitani was also probably considering moves at A, B or C. ]
(;W[jj]C[ Go took 7 minutes on White 56. He commented that, if he played at "a".. ]
(;B[dk]C[ Diving into an opponent's framework like this and rampaging about inside it is the supreme art of the Kitani style. He started with the contact play at 57 but he could also have played at "a". ];W[dj];B[cj]C[ The cross-cut of Black 59 means that he will sacrifice one stone or the other depending on the development. ]
(;W[ek];B[dl];W[cl];B[ej];W[di]
(;B[el]C[ If Black played 65 at "a".. ];W[fk];B[fl]
(;W[gk]C[ If White plays at "a".. ];B[gl]
(;W[hk]C[ The moves from 63 to 70 are naturally a one-way street. If White 70 is played at "a".. White has no choice but to play 70. ];B[cm]
(;W[bj]C[ Go commented that if White answered Black 71 at "a".. ]
(;B[ci]C[ If Black played 73 at "a".. ];W[ch];B[bk]
(;W[bi]C[ If White had played at "a".. ]
(;B[bl]C[ Black 77 was the sealed move at the end of the second day. 77 is the only move. Black may wish to push at "a" instead but.. ];W[hl];B[fo];W[fn];B[en]
(;W[cj]C[ White 82 is unavoidable. The semiai from "a" on is bad for White. ];B[dm];W[gm]
(;B[hm]C[ Black 85 was a brilliant move. Without it, White can make a large gain in the fight. In addition, it leaves behind the possibility of attacking the lower White group if the opportunity arises to extend at A. If Black takes sente with "b".. ];W[eo];B[em];W[bo];B[bq];W[hb];B[ib];W[he]C[ Black could have prevented White taking these points at Black 85 but at the peril of fighting a ko. These two plays make White's territory in this area worth about 65 points. Black has about 85 overall, so he needs to reduce the White area on the right to less than 20 points.];B[ie];W[hf];B[kh]C[ Black 95 took 52 minutes. The reason Kitani continued to think so long was that the position was so difficult. ]
(;W[kg]C[ Go commented that he had considered playing at "a". ];B[qq]C[ Black 97 took 1 hour 5 minutes. ];W[qp];B[qn]C[ 55 minutes.]
(;W[rn]C[ If White had played 100 at "a".. ]
(;B[qk]C[ Black 101 took 55 minutes. The reason Black took so long over these moves was that the position was so difficult. If Black plays at "a" now.. ];W[rj]
(;B[ro]
(;W[pn]C[ White 4 is forced. If he plays at "a".. But now Black A, White "a" and Black B remain to give Black life in the corner. ]
(;B[pj]C[ If Black plays at "a" or "b" with 5.. ];W[pk];B[pi]
(;W[qo]C[ White would prefer not to have to play at 8 and play instead at "a". ]
(;B[rk]C[ Kitani said that Black 9 showed a slight loss of nerve. He should have moved out into the centre with "a". ]
(;W[ki]C[ White 10 was a quick-witted defence of the centre. If White worries too much about \\t and adds a move at "a", Black may dare to pull out his single stone \\s, as he has been aiming for some time. ];B[rl];W[ql];B[or]C[ Black 13 is now well-timed. ]
(;W[nr]C[ If White plays at "a".. White therefore lets Black live in the corner. ];B[pr];W[nq]
(;B[rr]C[ Black 17 is correct shape. If he plays at "a" instead.. ];W[rp];B[rq]
(;W[sh]C[ At this point White 20 caused a great commotion. Go commented that he played 20 thinking it gave a 2 point profit. Playing at "a" is the most worthless play. ]
(;B[sj]C[ Go remarked that he was shocked when Black launched a major counterattack and caught him unawares with the ko. ];W[si];B[sl]C[ At this point it was 8pm on the third day's play. ];W[sk]C[ Go thought for 3 minutes about playing White 24. ];B[fb]C[ Kitani thought for 10 minutes about Black 25. He remarked that it was a one point loss. ];W[gb]C[ White 26 took 1 minute. ];B[sj]C[ On move 27 the game recorder informed Kitani that he had 30 minutes left. "Is that all?" ];W[ri]C[ Go commented that there was nothing else he could do. ];B[rh]C[ Black 29 took 5 minutes. Kitani remarked that this was big and also that he was tired. ]
;W[sg];B[rg];W[sf];B[rf]
(;W[sd]C[ White 34 is a very good move. If he played at "a".. ];B[re];W[se];B[rd];W[rc];B[rb];W[qc];B[qb];W[pc];B[sb];W[sc];B[pb];W[rm]C[ After crawling up the right side, White 46 finalises the preparations. Since Black has been filling in his own territory it becomes a huge ko. ]
;B[ok]C[ Black 47 is a now-or-never forcing move. ];W[pl];B[pd];W[sk];B[cc]C[ If White now captures the four Black stones, Black will live in the upper left and what was White's treasure house will become just a sliver of territory. ];W[db]C[ Nevertheless, by answering here, Black's threats go on and on, while White's threats against the lower right corner are barely more than one. ];B[sj];W[sq];B[sr];W[sk];B[cb]C[ If we consider the profit and loss account of the ko fight, in comparison with normal endgame play, White will have expanded his territory by 3 points and Black's will be reduced by 17. The size of the ko is worth about 39 points, so Black has to obtain compensation of about two-thirds or 26 points. Life in the upper left corner corresponds nicely to that. However, while Go was considering his answer to Black 57, Kitani collapsed with a nose-bleed. Kitani tried to sit at the side of the board holding a cold towel to his forehead. Since Kitani had only 9 minutes left of his time, if Go played while he was incapacitated, he would start to lose time he could not afford. Go considered for 30 minutes before playing.. ]
;W[sm]C[ White 58, settling the ko. Kitani asked whether they could break and Go agreed. The referee decreed a 20 minutes respite. Go went to get some tea while Kitani went to cool his head. Go was asked later why he had not volunteered to break while Kitani's nose-bleed was attended to; he remarked that he had not noticed. ];B[dd]
(;W[ed]C[ White 60 is forced: if he plays at "a"... ];B[be];W[cd];B[bd];W[ce];B[bb];W[ab]C[ White 66 is played so that he can take sente. ];B[ca];W[da];B[bf];W[ac];B[ad]
;W[bg];B[af]C[ Black living in the corner was worth 27 points; Black's territory is increased by 7 and White's reduced by 20. The ko increased White's territory by 3 and reduced Black's by 17. ];W[ld]C[ But since White can play White 74, worth 7 points, the result is even.
