On this day, Sakata Eio 9-dan and Hashimoto Utaro 9-dan's game was also played here.  Kitani \[Minoru\] 9-dan and Fujisawa \[Hosai\] 9-dan also came to watch the games.   All six participants of the Strongest Deciding Matches gathered at the same place -- indeed a rare opportunity. *)];B[cd]C[(* In this game, Go Seigen 9-dan defied the traditional way of playing the so-called "great avalanche" joseki, making a revolutionary new variation that shocked Japan's Go world. *)

(* Generally speaking, new variations in josekis are made due to the following two reasons:

(* First, based on the surrounding situation, any known joseki moves is not satisfactory.  Therefore, to fit the current situation, one decides to make a change, thus a new move.

(* Second, contrary to the above case, one has fully studied a new move 
already, and he attempts to apply it in practice on purpose; or, in a game under appropriate situation, he suddenly realizes it's time to make this new move.

(* In the first case, a new move is made by chance under a special situation, therefore its application is quite limited.

(* Only the new moves made in the second case are purely new moves. The new variation Go Seigen 9-dan made has a fundamentally difference in the order of moves with the way everyone had been playing in the most popular "great avalanche" joseki.  Strictly speaking, it's a "revolutionary 
joseki." This joseki is extremely valuable for study, and it will be widely used hereafter. *)]
;W[pp]C[Playing at hoshi points \[stars\] is what Mr. Takagawa likes. In the creation of New Fuseki Era, Mr. Kitani and I had studied san-ren-sei fuseki, and we often played at hoshi points.  Recently Mr. Takagawa often chooses these openings.];B[oc]C[B #5 to enclose at \[a\] is also a beautiful move.];W[ed]C[W #6 also can approach from a lower position, point \[a\].

W played hoshi points at the two corners at the lower side, so he tries to get a high position at the top side as well.  To here, it's an opening also commonly seen if the colors are reversed -- That is, if B gets two hoshi points at the lower side, and W plays two komoku \[3-4 points\] at the upper side, B would then play \[E16\].]LB[ec:a];B[ec]C[With #7, Black is expecting that W will choose the "avalanche" joseki.

(;B[fc];W[pj]C[W #12 is the biggest point on the board.

This move to play \[a\] at the lower side to form san-ren-sei is also a pretty strong formation, but W #12 also prevents B from extending from the komoku shimari \[corner enclosure\] at the upper right.  Therefore, #12 is the biggest point.]LB[jp:a];B[nq]LB[jq:a]C[In the past, B #13 had been normally played at \[a\] to split the side, but nowadays it's more often played as shown to approach the corner.
