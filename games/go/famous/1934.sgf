Played over 14 sessions between 16 Oct 1933 and 29 Jan 1934, at Kajibashi Ryokan in Kyobashi, Tokyo.  Time: 24 hours each (move times given here if over 1 hour)];C[ Shusai came out of a ten-year retirement to play this game. Go Seigen was not chosen as his opponent - he had to earn that privilege by winning the Japan Go Championship. But it is said that when he beat Hashimoto Utaro in the final, response of the head of Yomiuri Newspapers was simply: "Thank goodness." ]W[cd];B[dp];W[pq]C[ Shusai was shocked by Black's opening. But he stuck with the classical moves for White "as an expression of my personal beliefs." ];B[jj]C[ Shusai was scathing of Go's opening: "Creative innovation in go is to be welcomed with sympathetic interest, but regrettably Black's opening plays, which are characteristic of the `New Fuseki', have already been found wanting and are falling into disuse."  His distaste was echoed by correspondents to the Yomiuri newspaper who alleged disrepect by Go towards the senior player.  Go himself was later to dismiss 5 as a "straitjacket" move, being concerned only with influence - the best plays combine territory and influence. But he was adamant that his intention was not to annoy the Meijin. he wanted to test out his new concepts against the best player available and a play at the centre point (which is what provoked annoyance - not the other two black moves) was, he said, simply a result of his feeling at the time that it formed a logical symmetry with his two corner stones. ]
;W[pd];B[qd];W[pe];B[ob];W[qn]C[ Best, since all the corners are occupied. ];B[jp]C[ Better here than `a' because of the centre stone. ];W[lq]C[ Forestalls `a'. If White `b' instead, Black `c' becomes a good point.  Go Seigen did not think this was White's best answer to his innovation, but he did not suggest an alternative. ]
(;B[dj]C[ Lukewarm to some, although consistent with the New Fuseki strategy. The modern preference would be to play `a' or `b'. Indeed Go himself thought `a' was not only better but so good that it put White \\t in question. ];W[ed];B[lo]C[ Threatens `a'. ]
(;W[nq]C[ Kitani and Go thought `a' was perhaps better. Shusai himself conceded that he could have played more strongly (he suggested `b') but he was worried about Black's invasion at 16. He realised later, however, that he had a satisfactory answer to this (see variation). ]
(;B[kq]C[ Slack. He should play `a'. ];W[lp];B[ko]C[ Makes a nice framework, but still slack, said Kitani and Go. ];W[ch]C[ Best point here. ]
(;B[gj]C[ Go regretted this as too lukewarm. Suggested alternatives were `a', `b' and `c'. ];W[fq]C[ A severe encroachment into Black's framework. White can live easily. ]
(;B[fo]C[ If `a'... ];W[iq]
(;B[gp]C[ Black would like to play `a' but White then gets out safely. ];W[cq];B[cp];W[dq]C[ White has achieved life with about 10 points. His play can be regarded as a success. The fault lies with the slow move at \\t. ];B[nd]C[ Excellent. Forces White's reply. ];W[ph]C[ (1h 13)  However, Shusai said this should have been at `a' because Black's next move is too strong an attack. ];B[pj]C[ Shusai praised this, although Go thought maybe `a' was better (but he then has to allow White 31, which some thought was too good to allow).  In any event the focus is now on who gets to play at `a' (or `b'). ];W[ne]C[ White has to strengthen his group somehow because of the centre stone \\t. ];B[me]
(;W[mf]C[ A standard procedure. `a' instead is too conservative. ];B[nf]
(;W[ng]C[ Part of a standard combination with \\t. If at `a' instead... ];B[oe];W[of];B[ne];W[nj]C[ A probe. ]
(;B[om]C[ Shusai confessed to being unsettled by this move. If `a'  or `b'...? In both cases better for White.  The focus is still on getting to `a' first, but Black is skilfully looking ahead to the next big point. ]
(;W[mg]C[ If `a'... ]
(;B[ke]C[ `a' is not yet possible. ]
(;W[hc]C[ GSG: "An excellent play now." He dare not play `a' instead. ];B[qm]C[ White has won the race to play \\t, but Black has created compensation for himself with this move. ];W[rm]
(;B[rn]C[ A powerful combination praised by Shusai.  Note that Black must not play 47 at `a'. ]
(;W[rl]C[ (1h 26)  Best, all agree. The first fight of the game begins and the game takes an unexpected turn, with neither side giving way.  If `a' instead...? ];B[ro]
(;W[pm]C[ The first of five distinct  middle-game battles starts.  If `a'... ];B[ql];W[qk];B[pl];W[pn];B[pk];W[qj];B[nl]
(;W[pi]C[ The alternative `a' is a failure. ]
(;B[qp]C[ `a' leads to a ko and thus success for White. ];W[on];B[nn];W[no];B[mo]
(;W[op]C[ If `a'...? ];B[qr];W[qq]C[ Shusai said `a' would have been better from the point of view of ko threats later. ];B[rq];W[pr];B[rr]C[ The end of the first battle, with honours even. Black has gained the corner, but White has settled his groups and has sente. ]
(;W[mn]C[ The second batle starts. Preparation for playing at `a'. To go there at once would be premature. ];B[nm];W[lm]C[ `a' is still premature; Black connects at `b'. ];B[ll];W[kp];B[mp];W[mq];B[ip]C[ He cannot connect at `a' now that \\t have been played. ];W[jq]C[ No mean profit. ];B[kk]C[ End of the second battle. Still honours even ]
(;W[cn]C[ (3h 1)  Now the third battle begins.  A bit too painstaking, according to some. But the only alternative seems to be `a'. ];B[ep]C[ Inevitable. ];W[cj]C[ White challenges Black to a fight. ];B[ck];W[dk];B[cl]C[ Strongest in the circumstances. ];W[dl]C[ White goes all out too. He is sacrificing these two stones to build a wall. ];B[ci];W[bj];B[bi]C[ Black has to sacrifice in turn. ]
;W[di];B[ej];W[bh]C[ White successfully gets a 50-50 result from this manoeuvre. ]
(;B[dm]C[ Shusai thought `a' was better. ];W[ei]
(;B[fj]C[ It is painful for Black to have to connect here, though Shusai thought it correct. Go wondered whether he should have tried `a'.  But `b' is out of the question for Black. The ladder is against him. ];W[cm]
(;B[ak]C[ A tesuji worth remembering. If `a' instead... ];W[ai];B[el]C[ The third battle ends. Yet again there has been no clear victor.  There is now a "mopping up" phase before yet another battle begins. ]
(;W[bp]C[ The biggest move now - more valuable than `a'. ]
(;B[rf]C[ Now the biggest move. Better than `a', which is gote.  However, Shusai thought Black could have tried `b'. ];W[co];B[qg];W[rh]
(;B[jc]C[ (1h 29)  Shusai said this was the last chance to take `a'. ]
(;W[gq]C[ Poor. He should play `a' and then Black would have to fight hard to stop his centre being eaten up. ];B[eq]C[ (1h 8)  This put White on the spot, Shusai admitted. ];W[en]
(;B[fn]C[ `b' was a better block, and Segoe Kensaku pointed out that `a' was another alternative - Shusai favoured this too. ];W[er]C[ (3h 37) ]
(;B[fr]C[ It is difficult to say whether `a' would have been better. ];W[dr];B[hq];W[hr];B[hp];W[gr]
(;B[fc]C[ The fourth mid-game battle begins! Much better than `a'. He does not have to fear White `b'.  At this stage Shusai felt the game was one point either way. ];W[ic]C[ A strong move, keeping pace with Black. Shusai said White had to resort to a life-or-death struggle as there was no other way to win the game. ];B[dc];W[cc]
(;B[gd]C[ `a' might have been stronger, but... ];W[he]C[ (1h 10) ];B[ge];W[je]C[ A clever move. If Black answers it directly, White `a' will leave him in a fraught position. ];B[hd];W[id]
(;B[hf]C[ Black confirms his escape but at the cost of stranding \\t. If `a' instead...];W[kd];B[le];W[kc]C[ The fourth battle ends, and still no quarter has been given. Through skilful play on White's part, a finely balanced trade has taken place and the outcome still cannot be predicted. ];B[og]C[ Big, but White has `a' as compensation. ];W[oh];B[pg];W[em];B[ek];W[fm];B[gm];W[mb]C[ White can probably be satisfied with this move, even though he has lost three stones \\t. The value of 138 is that it prevents Black `a'. ]
;B[cb]C[ Shusai expected `a'. ];W[ec];B[eb];W[dd];B[db];W[gb];B[bc]C[ Probably too greedy. Patiently protecting against the cut with `a' was better.  Black cashed in the territory because he felt the game was so close, but Go admitted later that this was where he stumbled. He perhaps overlooked that there was another vicious battle to come. ];W[bd];B[bb];W[nb];B[oa];W[fb]C[ A quiet but ominous prelude to the final battle of the middle game. The significance of this cut is that it is sente, and by letting White pursue him in the centre Black is laying himself open to a devastating move 160. ]
;B[ea];W[gh]
(;B[jf]C[ Not `a'. ];W[ie];B[ff]C[ Striving for life. ];W[hi];B[hg]C[ Premature, thought Shusai. He would have considered `a'. ];W[eo];B[fp]C[ Indispensable, despite what comes next. ]
(;W[hl]C[ This has been called "The most brilliant move ever played". But who played it?  It came on the 13th day of play. On 15 January, Black had sealed 159. In the intervals between the playing days a crush of pupils and close relatives crowded into Shusai's majestic house in Tokyo and pored over the game. Among those present were his three main pupils, Maeda, Murashima and Takahashi, though they were also joined by eminent players such as Fukuda, Hagiwara, Masubuchi, Miyashita and Yasunaga. There have been persistent rumours ever since that White 160 was really discovered by Maeda Nobuaki.  Shusai himself seemed to discount these rumours, and in any event he could hardly cut himself off from his pupils, who were willing him to win, not just as their teacher but for the honour of Japan. And it was commonly accepted that in this position, though the game was close, White had to do something at least a little extraordinary to win. It seems the analysis took place along the lines of "Let's try this and make it work" rather than pure inspiration.  In his own researches Go (Kitani was his only helper) found this move too, and knew that if it was played against him he had lost.  Whatever the truth, it is a brilliant move, and wins the game. It stares at weak black groups to north, south, east and west. Its ultimate effect is to capture the black stones \\t.  Note that `a'instead fails, and `b' is met by `c'. ]
(;B[il]C[ (1h 25)  Dangerous and odd, but the only defence. `a' fails. ]
(;W[jh]C[ Attacking another weak group, but actually intended to make use of \\t. Having this stone on the board helps in the capturing race. `a' straightaway fails. ]
(;B[fh]C[ The best answer. Not `a'. ];W[fi]
(;B[hj]C[ Again the best answer. `a' leads nowhere. ];W[if];B[ih];W[ii];B[ig];W[jg];B[ji];W[fg];B[kf];W[ij]C[ This and his next two moves are part of the preparation necessary to pull out his stones \\t at `a'. ];B[ik];W[hh]
;B[gf]
(;W[mk]C[ Correct. `a' fails. ];B[df];W[ml];B[sm]C[ Getting in the forcing move before his stones \\t are captured. ];W[sk];B[mm];W[dg]C[ Essential, and better than `a'. If omitted, White's top group will be captured by Black `b'. ];B[li]C[ (1h)  Cannot be omitted, which means that Black has to surrender his stones \\t. ];W[ol];B[ln]C[ Better than `a' to avoid giving White an extra ko threat. ]
;W[nk];B[km];W[fl];B[gl];W[oj]C[ At last White completes capture of Black's five stones - the result of \\t. The negotiations beforehand were long and complex but both sides appear to have done the best possible. White now has a small but clear lead. ];B[qh];W[ri];B[cf]C[ `a' would have been better, though not enough to affect the outcome. ];W[ef];B[gi];W[eh];B[ee]
;W[eg]C[ It would be too dangerous in this situation to fight the ko by cutting at `a'. ];B[de];W[bf];B[bq];W[br];B[ps];W[os];B[qs];W[oq];B[bo];W[aq];B[an];W[bn]
;B[am];W[ao]
(;B[rg]C[ Now the biggest, thought Go and Kitani, because Black can force White to fill in at `b', although another view was that `a' was stronger. ];W[mi];B[qi];W[lh];B[kh];W[lj];B[rj];W[rk];B[sh];W[sj]C[ Now it is apparent that White will have to make the extra move at `a'. ];B[bg];W[ae]C[ A tesuji and the reason why \\t was not the best. ]

W: 22h 16; B: 22h 6  Shusai said that of all the eight critical games he had played (and he won all of them), no opponent had proven as formidable as Go Seigen. As for Go, he said that the game was being played when he was changing his style and was experimenting. He doubted whether White's countermeasures to his experiments were always the best possible. But there were several separate battles in the middle game and it was Black who lost his way. "What an unforgettable game!" he said. ]
