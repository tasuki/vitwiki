(;B[ck]C[ Black could also play either "a" or "b" first. ]
(;W[ed]C[ According to Suzuki Tamejiro 9-dan "a" is preferable, but then the whole course of the game would have been changed, not just the joseki moves in this corner. ]
(;B[df]C[ Hashimoto Shoji calls this a tenacious move. If Black played "a" instead.. ];W[ei]

(;B[ek];W[bj]C[ White 26 is a quiet move characteristic of Senchi. If White plays elsewhere, then Black would play at 26 and then at A, putting White in an awkward situation. ];B[qo];W[jq]C[ Normally a move on the third line, where the opponent can press down making the position low, would be taboo. ];B[op];W[oq];B[np];W[nq];B[mp];W[mq];B[lp];W[lq]

(;B[pe]C[ Hashimoto Shoji recommended Black "a" instead of 37, since this move is too orthodox. If Black had played at "b".. ];W[qj]C[ However, Senchi was content with getting 38 in to erase Black's influence. ]
(;B[nd]C[ Black 39 is the convential move of the day, but modern professionals think that this would be better left until Black is sure whether he wishes to play here or at "a". However, White would very much like to play at A in order to develop the upper side. ];W[mc];B[qh]
(;W[bk]C[ If White had played at "a".. White 42 is seen to be another quiet and persevering move. ];B[ql];W[oj]
(;B[bl]C[ Black 45 is questionable because it is a bit too hasty or perhaps played out of fighting spirit. A move at "a" or "b" would have been sounder. ];W[cl]C[ White 46 is a dauntless move.

(;W[gh]C[ White 58 is another good, tenacious move. By leaning against Black 57 White reinforced his group and was able to make an attack on the Black group in the middle.
