# Go Variants

Go variants that caught my eye...

## Simpler rules

- [No contact go](https://senseis.xmp.net/?NoContactGo) - do not touch opponent stones
- [One eyed go](https://senseis.xmp.net/?OneEyedGo) - no suicide allowed

## Different boards

- [Torus](https://senseis.xmp.net/?ToroidalGo) exists, also on little golem.
- Generate go boards based on street layout, a la Milton Keynes

## Other

- Continuous, I built it!
- Real time madness play - TODO
