# A List of Famous Go Games

Made before AlphaGo. YMMV. I might add some newer games one day.

- 1582 ★★★★★★ [_Nikkai, Honinbo Sansa_ vs _Kashio Rigen_ – Tripple ko](famous/1582.sgf)
	- At night, after the game, the emperor Nobunaga was killed. Since then the tripple ko is a bad sign. In the kifu there is no tripple ko, it is incomplete.
- 1625 ★ [_Nakamura Doseki_ vs _Yasui Santetsu_ – W+](famous/1625.sgf)
	- First move was, somewhat strangely, played on the side.
- 1682 ★ [_Honinbo Dosaku (Meijin)_ vs _Peichin Hamahika_ (4handicap) – W+14](famous/1625.sgf)
	- First official international match, Peichin visited Japan, but he was crushed by the go-saint in four handicap.
- 1683 ★★★★★ [_Honinbo Dosaku (Meijin)_ vs _Yasui Shunchi_ (2handicap) – B+1](famous/1683.sgf)
	- Dosaku's masterpiece – 2 handicap lost by one point. Today's professionals say that the fuseki is aged, that today even amateurs would play it better, but in the middle game Shunchi played a sequence of excellent moves. How Dosaku was able to catch up to 1 point difference is nearly incomparable.
- 1705 ★★★★ [_Yasui Senkaku_ vs _Honinbo Dochi_ – B+1](famous/1705.sgf)
	- Dochi's surprising endgame tesuji brought him 2 points and the win.
- 1740 ★★★★ [_Shi Xiangxia_ vs _Cheng Lanru_ – W+](famous/1740.sgf)
	- *Nine dragons playing with a pearl*. All the groups fighting endlessly. Nothing clearly alive for a very long time.
- 1792 ★ [_Yasui Senchi Senkaku_ vs _Honinbo Retsugen_ – W+R](famous/1792.sgf)
	- Senkaku's style – influence, Senkaku turned the game around with the fight.
- 1812 ★ [_Honinbo Genjo_ vs _Nakano Chitoku (Yasui Senchi)_ – B+R](famous/1812.sgf)
	- Move 69 looks nearly like a pass, no one is sure why it was played.
- 1815 ★ [_Honinbo Jowa_ vs _Hattori Rittetsu (Gennan Inseki)_ – B+4](famous/1815.sgf)
	- Masterpiece of Gennan against his irreconcilable rival.
- 1820 ★★ [_Yasui Senchi_ vs _Honinbo Jowa_ – B+2](famous/1820.sgf)
	- Marked as the best game of the Edo period. Although Black kept the advantage of the first move and won by two points, Senchi's amashi strategy is praised a lot.
- 1835 ★★★★★★★★ [_Honinbo Jowa (Meijin)_ vs _Akaboshi Intetsu_ – W+R](famous/1835.sgf)
	- *Blood-vomiting game*. Jowa, who as a Meijin couldn't afford to lose, had to face a new secret trick joseki (move 33) that gave Akaboshi an advantage. But Jowa then played three brilliant tesuji (68, 70, 80) and turned the game around. After a week of playing, Intetsu collapsed, started to vomit blood, and died a few days later.
- 1842 ★★★ [_Inoue Genan Inseki_ vs _Honinbo Shuwa_ – B+6](famous/1842.sgf)
	- The match of two players who had the strength of a Meijin but never became one. Jowa commented that Gennan was strong enough to become a Meijin but was unfortunately born in the wrong time. In the endgame Gennan was losing by one point, so he tried to live in the corner but failed, raising the difference to six points.
- 1844 ★ [_Honinbo Shuwa_ vs _Yasui Sanchi_ – B+1](famous/1844.sgf)
	- Move 63 is a very strange shape — a *nobi* where you wouldn’t expect it.
- 1846 ★★★★★★★★★★ [_Inoue Genan Inseki_ vs _Kuwahara Shusaku_ – B+3](famous/1846.sgf)
	- *Ear-reddening game*. The legendary move 127, just next to tengen, with which Shusaku surprised Gennan as well as onlookers and reversed an unfavourable game.
- 1851 ★★★ [_Honinbo Shuwa_ vs _Honinbo Shusaku_ – B+4](famous/1851.sgf)
	- Well-known to fans of *Hikaru no Go* — the first game between Touya Akira and Shindo Hikaru (Sai) in the anime is based on this one.
- 1852 ★★ [_Honinbo Shusaku_ vs _Ito Showa_ – W+R](famous/1852.sgf)
	- Confrontation of two generations — Shusaku (22) with white defeats Showa (50).
- 1853 ★★★ [_Honinbo Shusaku_ vs _Ota Yuzo_ – W+3](famous/1853.sgf)
	- With this game Shusaku forces Yuzo to handicap and wins the most famous match of the Edo period. Slow but thick move 88 says: “Just this is enough to win.”
- 1895 ★★ [_Honinbo Shuei_ vs _Tamura Hoju (Honinbo Shusai)_ – W+2](famous/1895.sgf)
	- *Geta game*. Move 92 is a well-known tesuji with escaping to geta, which saves white stones.
- 1926 ★★★ [_Honinbo Shusai (Meijin)_ vs _Karigane Junichi_ – W+T](famous/1926.sgf)
	- Kiseisha vs Nihon Ki-in. One of the most difficult games in history full of fighting (70-move semeai, etc). It was shown on huge boards in Tokyo gardens and contributed to the popularization of go.
- 1929 ★★★★★ [_Kitani Minoru_ vs _Go Seigen_ – W+3](famous/1929.sgf)
	- Go Seigen plays mirror go to move 65; Kitani plays a surprising tesuji at move 114.
- 1933 ★★★ [_Go Seigen_ vs _Kosugi Tei_ – W+R](famous/1933.sgf)
	- *16 soldiers*, shin fuseki style. Go crushed his opponent using influence and attacking all groups.
- 1934 ★★★★★ [_Honinbo Shusai (Meijin)_ vs _Go Seigen_ – W+2](famous/1934.sgf)
	- *Game of the century*. Go plays shin fuseki — diagonal sansan, tengen, hoshi. Meijin adjourned the game at his leisure, and turned it around with tesuji on 160, reportedly found by his pupil Maeda Nobuaki.
- 1938 ★★★★★★★ [_Honinbo Shusai (Meijin)_ vs _Kitani Minoru_ – B+5](famous/1938.sgf)
	- *Retirement game* of Honinbo Shusai. Yasunari Kawabata wrote the novel *Meijin* about this game.
- 1939 ★★★★★ [_Go Seigen_ vs _Kitani Minoru_ – W+2](famous/1939.sgf)
	- First game from the most famous match of a new era (Kamakura jubango) between the authors of shin fuseki. Kitani started bleeding at move 128.

- 1957 ★ [_Takagawa Kaku_ vs _Go Seigen_ – B+R](famous/1957a.sgf)
	- Go Seigen played the large avalanche.
- 1959 ★★ [_Go Seigen_ vs _Takagawa Kaku (Honinbo Shukaku)_ – B+0.5](famous/1959.sgf)
	- A *ko* dispute — White had more threats but had to connect anyway.

	- *The broken ladder game*. Lee Sedol intentionally played out a ladder which didn't work for him.
