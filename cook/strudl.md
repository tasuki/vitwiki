# Štrůdl, aka jablečný závin

Prepare:

* 2 rolls puff pastry (listové těsto, ciasto francuskie), room temperature
* bread crumbs (strouhanka, bułka tarta), to soak the apple juice
* 4-5 large to 6-7 small apples, best grated (or cut into small pieces)
* walnuts
* raisins
* cinnamon
* sugar

Wrap things up, bake in preheated oven on 200°C for ~20 minutes.

* Sprinkle with powdered sugar (cukr moučka, cukier puder).

Alternately half portion, second roll with spinach and cheese:
* 3 cloves of ground garlic in a bit of oil
* 900g frozen spinach works about right for one roll
* unfreeze, salt to pepper to taste, leave to cool before wrapping
* when wrapping: bread crumbs underneath, sprinkle with cheese
